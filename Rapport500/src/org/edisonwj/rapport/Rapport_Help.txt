RAPPORT is a tool for generating random sets of point, line, and polygon structures
for testing geometric algorithms and related geometric applications. The original
version was created in 2003, and has been updated with this version in 2020, primarily
adding the ability to output resulting data files in a format that can be read and 
processed by the Draw3D application. At this point there are certainly more sophicticated
and robust geometric data generators available; however, RAPPORt does provide for
generation of some interesting data classes.
